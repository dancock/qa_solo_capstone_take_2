## Summary

This project was put together to test bonnieplants.com. For the automation, it uses Jest as a test
runner, and Selenium Webdriver to hook into the browser. Manual test cases are on Jira. 

## Setup

This is how to set up our project.

1. clone it!
1. `npm i`

## Running Tests

To run all the tests, use the command: `npm test`

To run a specific test, use the command: `npx jest test_name`

## What Do We Test

DRH - The functionality I tested for was the Advanced Search. I searched for keywords, and found the keywords on the results. I also found the results on the results. I used the Movies searchbar and the People searchbar. I took screenshots and added keywords to JSON and txt files.

## How Do We Test

We organized our tests using this structure...

### Page Objects

We made page objects for these pages because...

- BasePage
  - A base page for page objects.
- AdvSearchPage
  - A page for the methods and variables that Dan used for the Advanced Search test.
- page 3...

### Data Files

Dan's test creates screenshots of search results and sends keywords to JSON and txt files.
